# Connect4-game
This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built as part of my internship with InternPe, this project demonstrates core web development skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic implementation, and responsive styling.
